# NNEF-Docs

This repository (https://github.com/KhronosGroup/NNEF-Docs) is currently
empty, and is used only to file issues about the NNEF Specification.

The NNEF Specification is hosted in the Khronos <a
href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/NNEF/"> NNEF Registry</a>, but this
is simply a publication mechanism. Actual specification issues should be
filed here in NNEF-Docs.
